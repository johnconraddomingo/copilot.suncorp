# Customizing your Key Bindings for GitHub Copilot

You can customize key bindings for GitHub Copilot commands in Visual Studio Code by rebinding the shortcuts in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor using your preferred keyboard shortcuts for each specific command. Here are the steps to do so:

1. In the menu bar, click Code, click Preferences, then click Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. In the "Keyboard Shortcuts" editor, search for the command name of the keyboard shortcut you want to change.
3. Next to the command you want to change, click the pencil icon.
4. Type the keystrokes you want to use for the command, then press Enter/Return.
5. Ensure that the key combination you select does not conflict with any other key bindings in Visual Studio Code.

## Example

1. Rebind `/explain` to Ctrl+E, X (Pressing Ctrl+E followed by X)
2. Rebind `/fix` to Ctrl+E, F (Pressing Ctrl+E followed by F)

These key bindings are useful if you frequently use any of these slash commands.
