# GitHub Copilot Training

This repository is used for the GitHub Copilot Developer Training Conducted by Avanade.

## Code Snippets for GitHub Copilot Demonstration

This repository includes a collection of code snippets that are specifically designed to showcase the capabilities of GitHub Copilot. These snippets can be used during presentations or demonstrations to highlight the power and efficiency of GitHub Copilot in generating code. Feel free to explore and utilize these snippets to enhance your understanding of GitHub Copilot's features.

This repository is designed for developers and trainers who are new or exploring the features of GitHub Copilot. It provides resources and materials specifically tailored to enhance their understanding and usage of GitHub Copilot.

## Training Overview

This training focuses on utilizing GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code, although the principles apply across all supported IDEs. While the primary languages used in examples are JavaScript and Python, the concepts and techniques can be applied to any programming language that GitHub Copilot supports.

Please note that this training assumes basic programming knowledge and focuses specifically on leveraging GitHub Copilot to enhance your coding efficiency and productivity.

## Pre-requisites

In order to follow along with the instructions provided in this repository, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [GitHub Copilot License](https://copilot.github.com/) - Please check with your leads on how to obtain your GitHub Copilot License.
- GitHub Copilot Extension for Visual Studio Code

Ensure you review the individual workshop's README.md file for more information on how to install the tools or dependencies required to successfully run the exercises for that workshop.

For example, the `Javascript` workshop has a [README.md](./exercise/javascript/README.md) file in that directory that details the prerequisites for that workshop.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with this training, you will need to install the GitHub Copilot extension in your VS Code. Once you have installed the extension, you can start following along the demos and exercises provided in this training course.
 
## Exercises

Individual workshops have their own exercises. These exercises are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts covered in the workshops. You can find the exercises in the `exercise` directory of each workshop.

There is also a `complete` directory of each workshop that contains the completed code for the exercises. You can refer to this directory to see the final state of the exercises.

For example, for the `Javascript` workshop, the exercises can be found on the `./exercise/javascript` directory while the completed code can be found on the `./complete/javascript` directory.

## Live exercises and self-paced coding challenges

Some workshops may include live exercises or self-paced coding challenges. These exercises are designed to test your understanding of GitHub Copilot and your ability to use it to generate code snippets.

Refer to the individual workshop's README.md file for more information on live exercises and coding challenges.
