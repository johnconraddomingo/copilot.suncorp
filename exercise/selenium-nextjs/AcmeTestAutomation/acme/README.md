### Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for development mode or `npm run debug` to enable server component debugging)
    - Run `npm run build` first if running `npm start`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/db/seed` to seed the database with sample data
    - Port `3000` is the default but it could be any port that was specified in the console output
    - This resets the databse and so should only be done once, or as needed
